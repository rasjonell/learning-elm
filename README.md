# Learning Elm

This project has some basic pages I've built while learning [elm](https://elm-lang.org).

# Running the code

If you have `elm` installed, you can clone the project, navigate to the project directory and run

```sh
elm reactor
```

Afterwards you can navigate to `localhost:8000` and from the dashbord choose the file to `.elm` file to compile and run in your browser.
